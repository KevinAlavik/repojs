# repojs

## About

A js package/library to handle iOS repos 

Developed by Kevin Alavik (aka puffer)

RepoJS is a way for web based stores to handle loading multiple apps using json repos

Example repos:

[Scylla Base Repo](https://getscylla.app/repo.json)

## Simple use

To use repojs you have to either install it with npm: `not impelemented` or use our cdn link for using it on the web: `not impelemented`

### Repo types

We only support **json** repos for now. You can define your own repo structure using the `defineRepo` function read more here `not impelemented`

If you dont want to define your own repo structure you could use existing ones such as [Scarlet](https://usescarlet.com/scarlet.json), [Scylla](https://getscylla.app/repo.json), AltStore

## Contributing

RepoJS is opensource see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for more info

#### Thanks for making the future of web based stores easier using repojs <3
