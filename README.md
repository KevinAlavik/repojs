# repojs

## About

A js package/library to handle iOS repos 

Developed by Kevin Alavik (aka puffer)

RepoJS is a way for web based stores to handle loading multiple apps using json repos

Example repos:

[Scylla Base Repo](https://getscylla.app/repo.json)

## Simple use

To use repojs you have to either install it with npm: `not impelemented` or use our cdn link for using it on the web: 
```html
<script src="https://puffer.is-a.dev/projects/repojs/cdn/lastest@0.1/stable.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

### Repo types

We only support **json** repos for now. You can define your own repo structure using the [structure repo yml file (read more here)]()

If you dont want to define your own repo structure you could use existing ones such as [Scarlet](https://usescarlet.com/scarlet.json), [Scylla](https://getscylla.app/repo.json), AltStore
